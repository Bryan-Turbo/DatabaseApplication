# DatabaseApplication
A small database application made for an assignment of 'Hogeschool Rotterdam'

## First setup
The first setup for this application was to create a program that connected to a database which could receive, update and remove data. 
For the database i used a MySQL database on my localhost with XAMPP.

## Change to local database: Enter SQLite
Because this application could only be used when the localhost was only, I decided to use a local database without the need for a localhost.
SQLite was the answer to this and after a little refactoring i got it working without too many issues.
